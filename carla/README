===============

Thanks for downloading CARLA!

How to run CARLA
----------------

Launch a terminal in this folder and execute the simulator by running

    $ ./CarlaUE4.sh

this will launch a window with a view over the city. This is the "spectator"
view, you can fly around the city using the mouse and WASD keys, but you cannot
interact with the world in this view. The simulator is now running as a server,
waiting for a client app to connect and interact with the world.

Mainly testing with the PythonAPI/test files

For more details and running options please refer to our online documentation
