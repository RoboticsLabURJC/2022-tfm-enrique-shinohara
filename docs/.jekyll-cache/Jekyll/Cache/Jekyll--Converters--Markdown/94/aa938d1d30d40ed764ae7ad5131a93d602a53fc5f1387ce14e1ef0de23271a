I"ž<p>With this first week after the summer vacation, I return to the routine with a similar task to the one I had at hand on the summer. Instead of training the car to follow a line, we are going to put our focus on training a car to follow a lane, bringing it closer to a real life problem with the autonomous driving task.</p>

<p>We are going to replicate the steps we took for the follow line problem so that we can resume improving the model and analyzing possible improvements. So, to recall, we had 3 major tasks to tackle:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create an explicit brain for the follow lane problem</li>
  <li>Create a dataset from the explicit brain algorithm</li>
  <li>Train with our dataset, a PilotNet model</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="creating-the-explicit-follow-line-brain">Creating the explicit follow-line brain</h2>

<p>The follow lane brain was already made as seen on the Week 3 post, but building upon this algorithm, I have improve it to take better the curves and to oscillate less when the left lane dissapears for a moment in an intersection.</p>
