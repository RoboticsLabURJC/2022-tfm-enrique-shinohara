I"F<p>For this week we need to focus on a variety of tasks:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Setting everything up for the new version of the Carla Simulator, such us, packages compatibility for us to keep using the same code used for the 0.9.2 version.</li>
  <li>To enrich our neural network adding the velocity on the training and prediction. Right now we are only using the steering values to learn the behaviour of the car.</li>
  <li>Learn and if possible, implement the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.12294">Learning by Cheating</a> paper onto our arquitecture. This should gives us a more robust training method but it requires a slightly different approach as the one taken up to now.</li>
</ul>

<p>To deal with the first two tasks, we need to collect a bunch of data from the new Carla version. This is done because one of the main differences with the new version and the old, as we mentioned on a previous post, resides on the refinement of the car physics. This alone is a feature that aimed to bring closer the simulation to the real world, so it basically changes completely how the car behaves on the simulator and therefore what it learns from it.</p>

<p>In order to gather our thoughts better, we are going to talk a little about the dataset and the different towns available to us from the 0.9.13 version of the Carla Simulator. The idea we came up with was to collect 30 minutes of autopilot data from the 2, 3 and 4 Town, leaving the Towns 1 and 5 for testing purposes.</p>

<p>The recollection gave us a total of 93.655 images for training and validation. The problem with using so much data, compared to the 32.674 on the previous version, is that the data balancing process as well as the training steps consume much more resources from our machine to the poin that it automatically kills the process for the lack of computation capability. But for the sake of coming with a solution, we go ahead and balance our data as shown in the next figure.</p>

<p>Once we have our data balanced we proceed like we did on previous cases, with training the model for the purpose of making the car follow the lane. To train the model, we go ahead and put as many epochs as possible, so that we could be able to analyze if it is training correctly or not. One of the main changes done to the parameters, is the learning rate of the training process. We wanted to see how the model adjust its weights along this two different values.</p>
