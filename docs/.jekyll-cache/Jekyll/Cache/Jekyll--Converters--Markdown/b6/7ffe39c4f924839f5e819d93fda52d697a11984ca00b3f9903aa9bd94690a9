I"À<p>For this week we have multiple work borders open that I am going to explain more in detailed in this post. To have a better visual of it, the task were as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Keep exploring some datasets to train from</li>
  <li>Study of FPS and latencies from the server-client model, Carla</li>
  <li>Be able to train a model in my local computer from a <a href="https://github.com/JdeRobot/DeepLearningStudio/tree/main/Formula1-FollowLine/tensorflow">dataset</a> made by <a href="https://sergiopaniego.github.io/">Sergio Paniego</a></li>
  <li>Refining the previous PilotNet model implemented in a vehicle from the Carla Simulator</li>
</ul>

<p>First, the exploration of the data, a task that I found more complicated than I thought, for most of the public dataset for self-driving cars were orientated towards segmentation and detection tasks. Despite these complications I could find some dataset from Udacity, an educational organization which has available multiple dataset for free, that comes with the images from RGB cameras, the steering and the throttle values among others that I find most useful for future task of my thesis.</p>

<p>Secondly I centered myself most of the week on trying to understand and comprehend the necessary information that comes from analyzing the frequencies on the server-client simulation that we are managing. To have a better visual of how our machine can handle the simulation demand of resources, we need to know if the speed at which the server is rendering new images is fast enought to keep with the client speed to recieve and process the images, and viceversa. In order to do this, we analyze the latencies in two possible ways, one where the client only recieves the images, and other where the client uses a model to predict the images output.</p>
