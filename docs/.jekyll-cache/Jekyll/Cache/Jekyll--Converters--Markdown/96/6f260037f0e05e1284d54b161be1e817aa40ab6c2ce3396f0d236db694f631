I"<p>As we make our way into the depths of the Carla Simulator, it is a good idea to grasp a better understanding of the Carla framework and its infrastructure. In order to do this, we need to start coding a “brain” for our car in the simulation, to be able to order commands and execute them on to the car, and as of now, our car needs two commands for the velocity: angular (steering angle) and linear (throttle or brake). For the sake of simplicity, the linear velocity will be constant, changing only the steering input.</p>
