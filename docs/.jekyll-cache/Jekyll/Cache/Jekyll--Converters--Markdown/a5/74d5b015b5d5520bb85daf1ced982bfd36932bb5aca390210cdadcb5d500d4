I"@<p>Carry on with the task at hand, we still need to figure out why the car is not turning when we increased the dataset with more turning situations. Wasnâ€™t the quantity of increased data enough? More tweaking on the augmentation to see which turning value needs more weight? Even more variability on the dataset?</p>
