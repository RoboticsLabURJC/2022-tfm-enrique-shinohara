I"7<p>I start my master’s thesis with the objective and hope to learn and solve problems related to autonomous driving. By mantaining a weekly log, I expect to keep myself motivated, to put my ideas in perspective in order to solve problems that I may encounter and to learn more and more about this fascinating union between robotics and computer vision.</p>

<p>A general idea of the thesis would be to understand and implement the underlying connection between autonomous cars and vision techniques used to learn, such us reinforcement or deep learning.</p>

<p>As tutors and advisors of my master thesis, I have the pleasure to count with:</p>
