I"?<p>Starting to warming up, as I am currently in the first training period of my thesis, I must read a lot of papers related to the task at hand, understand them and if possible, starting to plan the environment where I can begin to work. Given that the thesis revolves around reinforcement learning, my tutor and advisors kindly pointed me towards DeepMind famous projects, such as <a href="https://www.deepmind.com/research/highlighted-research/alphago">AlphaGo</a> or <a href="https://www.deepmind.com/blog/agent57-outperforming-the-human-atari-benchmark">Agent57</a>.</p>
