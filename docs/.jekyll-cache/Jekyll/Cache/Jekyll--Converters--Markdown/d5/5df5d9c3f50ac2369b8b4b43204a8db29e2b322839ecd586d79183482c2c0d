I"U<p>For this past few weeks I have been trying to install and configurate the <a href="https://github.com/JdeRobot/BehaviorMetrics">BehaviourMetrics</a> repository on my local computer. With this repository the main objective was to be able to have some quantifiable metrics in order to check with data how good is the follow-lane model.</p>
