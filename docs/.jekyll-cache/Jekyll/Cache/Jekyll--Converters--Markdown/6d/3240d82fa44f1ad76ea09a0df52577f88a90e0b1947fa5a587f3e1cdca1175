I"G<p>Hello World.</p>

<p>As we make our way into the depths of the Carla Simulator, it is a good idea to grasp a better understanding of the Carla framework and its infrastructure. In order to do this, we need to start coding a “brain” for our car in the simulation, we need to be able to order commands and execute them on to the car, and as of now, our car have two types of velocity: angular (steering angle) and linear (throttle or brake). For the sake of simplicity, at the moment the linear velocity will be constant, changing only the steering input.</p>

<p>The proposed objective right now is to implement a car to follow the road, keeping itself inside the lanes. In the case of intersections, the car will simply turn to the right, always.</p>
