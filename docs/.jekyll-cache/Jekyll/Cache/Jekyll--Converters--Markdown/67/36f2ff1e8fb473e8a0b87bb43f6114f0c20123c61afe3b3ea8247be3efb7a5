I"[<p>Hello World.</p>

<p>As we make our way into the depths of the Carla Simulator, it is a good idea to grasp a better understanding of the Carla framework and its infrastructure. In order to do this, we need to start coding a “brain” for our car in the simulation, we need to be able to order commands and execute them on to the car, and as of now, our car have two types of velocity: angular (steering angle) and linear (throttle or brake). For the sake of simplicity, at the moment the linear velocity will be constant, changing only the steering input.</p>

<p>Before we start with the coding section, we can play a little with the available Towns/Maps for the server. Doing a simple check on the maps, we have selected the Town02. This town is the easiest one roadwise, giving us better performance on low graphics when compared to other towns. Below, we can see the complexity of the roads on Town01, compared to Town02.</p>

<p>The objective right now is to implement a car to follow the road, keeping itself inside the lanes. In the case of intersections, the car will simply turn to the right, always. To do this, we want to hard code a simple program, that with a single RGB camera, it would extract the necessary information to follow the lane without getting out of it.</p>
