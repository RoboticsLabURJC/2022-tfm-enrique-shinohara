I"Z<p>As we saw in the previous post, we are very close to finally playing with some machine learning algorithms for our road following car. But as always, first we need to prepare the playground before we dive deep into the machine learning problems, and by preparing I mean installing the ever famous <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit">CUDA toolkit</a>, this tool will allow us to train and predict algorithms with GPU-acceleration by using the graphic card in our local machine. Given that I have a RTX 3060 6Gb graphics card in my laptop, it would be a total loss not to test it.</p>
