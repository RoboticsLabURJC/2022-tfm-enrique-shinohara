I"í<p>Simplification. That is the goal of our next task, by simplyfing the follow lane, we are going to build up the complexity of the problem. But first, we need to establish a good foundation for our next problems, and this foundation consist of a car capable of doing the same follow lane that it was possible on the 0.9.2 version of the Carla Simulation. One of the main changes resided on the possibility of using an already implemented autopilot instead of using our own (for now). The problem was that this autopilot was designed to randomly run around the roads of a given map, with this we are only adding very complex situations from the beginning such as intersections or junctions (that we need to take them into account, but not now).</p>
