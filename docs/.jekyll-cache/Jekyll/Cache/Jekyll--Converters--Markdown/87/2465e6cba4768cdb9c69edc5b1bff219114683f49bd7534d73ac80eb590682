I"ˆ<p>As a continuation of our current task, we are going to keep trying to make our car follow straight roads and turn on the curves correctly. As a reminder, we already had this feature on the 0.9.2 version of the Carla Simulation, but by upgrading to the 0.9.13 (in order to be able to use more of the latest features and realistic driving physics) the whole model had a little stepback that needed to be revisited. The problem mainly resides on the fundamental changes made to the car physics of the new Carla simulator, with this changes, we needed to create a new model that could learn this behaviour in order to drive correctly on the simulation. So, to resume, we needed to recollect data from the new version for us to train a new model for the follow-lane task, once we had this data we process it so that the model could learn meaningful information, and finally test it to see the results.</p>
