I"L	<p>As we enter a vacation period in our thesis planification, advances will surely slow down when we compared them with the previous weeks. But this does not mean that no progress will be made in the meantime. First, for the sake of organizing the month we need to know what our to-do list is going to be, meaning, what is the primary problem to be solved right now.</p>

<p>As we established in the sixth week, we need to refine even more the brain we are using to make our car, in the Carla Simulator, follow a line. We already made some improvements in the last week but they weren’t enough, for the car wasn’t technically following the line as the model was trained to do. In order to find where the problem might be, we tried to simulate pretty closely the <a href="https://github.com/JdeRobot/DeepLearningStudio">DeepLearningStudio</a> project (even though this one was trained on the Gazebo Simulator), that is, the image we feeded to the model was a close representation of the images from which they trained their models, and the outputs were scaled to try to translate the Gazebo values to Carla values. Because this changes didn’t make the car follow the line as we wanted it to, an assumption was made by thinking that the problem resided in the differences between the both simulations cars dynamics. To pinpoint wether this was true or not, we have to test it by training a model using a Carla Simulation based dataset.</p>

<p>Now that we have landed into the tasks at hand, the next steps can be divided in:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create an explicit brain to make our car follow a line. We already had a brain to make the car follow the road, but for the sake of undestanding the problem we explained beforehand, we need to simplify the task, by making it follow a line.</li>
  <li>Create a dataset for the follow-line task in the Carla Simulation. This dataset will be recolected with the use of the explicit follow-line brain.</li>
  <li>Train a model on our own with the recently created dataset, to see if it is capable of following the line better than the PilotNet-based model trained in Gazebo.</li>
</ul>
