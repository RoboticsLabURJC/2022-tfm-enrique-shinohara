I start my master's thesis with the objective and hope to learn and solve problems related to autonomous driving. By mantaining a weekly log, I expect to keep myself motivated, to put my ideas in perspective in order to solve problems that I may encounter and to learn more and more about this fascinating union between robotics and computer vision.

A general idea of the thesis would be to understand and implement the underlying connection between autonomous cars and vision techniques used to learn, such us reinforcement or deep learning.

As tutors and advisors of my master thesis, I have the pleasure to count with:
- [José María Cañas Plaza](https://gsyc.urjc.es/jmplaza/)
- [Sergio Paniego](https://roboticslaburjc.github.io/2019-phd-sergio-paniego/)
